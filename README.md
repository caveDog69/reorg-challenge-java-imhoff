This project was made with StackBlitz.com. It uses Vue.js and Vite using the vue. composition API.

The columns of the grid table are dymanically generated. This can be seen manupulating the dealData oject on line 3 of App.vue. There are three data sets available.

I ran into troulbe with the testing. I was unable to get vitest or jest to work correctly in this project in stackBlitz.
