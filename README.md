This project was made with StackBlitz.com. It uses Vue.js and Vite using the vue. composition API.

The columns of the grid table are dymanically generated. This can be seen manupulating the dealData oject on line 3 of App.vue. There are three data sets available.

I ran into troulbe with the testing. I was unable to get vitest or jest to work correctly in this project in stackBlitz. 

known bugs:
- the grid filtering does not work if the user uses the mouse to select from the list of remembered options


To run the project.
1) download the repo from github
2) run 'npm install'
3) run 'npm run dev'

Thanks
